# Data Structures Learning Examples

This directory contains interactive CLI programs to help you learn and practice different data structures.

## Available Data Structures

1. **Arrays** (`arrays_example.py`)
   - Basic operations: access, insert, delete
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for access, O(n) for insertion/deletion
   - Interactive examples and quizzes
   - Guided tutorial with step-by-step explanations

2. **Linked Lists** (`linked_list_example.py`)
   - Operations: append, prepend, insert, delete
   - Time Complexity: O(n) for access, O(1) for insertion at known position
   - Visual representation of links
   - Guided tutorial with node connection demonstrations

3. **Stacks** (`stack_example.py`)
   - LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
   - Operations: push, pop, peek
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
   - Includes undo/redo simulation
   - Guided tutorial with real-world examples

4. **Queues** (`queue_example.py`)
   - FIFO (First In First Out) principle
   - Operations: enqueue, dequeue
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
   - Includes printer queue simulation
   - Guided tutorial with practical applications

5. **Binary Trees** (`tree_example.py`)
   - Operations: insert, search, traversal
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) for balanced trees
   - Visual tree representation
   - Includes file system simulation
   - Guided tutorial with traversal demonstrations

6. **Graphs** (`graph_example.py`)
   - Operations: add vertex/edge, BFS, DFS
   - Time Complexity: varies by operation
   - Includes social network simulation
   - Guided tutorial with directed/undirected examples

## Features

Each data structure implementation includes:

1. **Guided Tutorial Mode**
   - Step-by-step explanations of concepts
   - Interactive demonstrations
   - Visual examples and analogies
   - Time complexity analysis
   - Real-world applications
   - Best practices and common pitfalls

2. **Interactive Practice**
   - Hands-on operations
   - Visual feedback
   - Time complexity insights
   - Error handling and validation

3. **Knowledge Testing**
   - Built-in quizzes
   - Concept verification
   - Performance understanding

4. **Real-World Simulations**
   - Practical use cases
   - Industry applications
   - Problem-solving scenarios

## How to Use

1. Choose a data structure you want to learn
2. Run the corresponding Python file:
   ```bash
   python arrays_example.py
   ```
3. From the main menu, you can:
   - Start the guided tutorial (recommended for beginners)
   - Try different operations
   - See time complexities
   - Take quizzes
   - Explore real-world examples

## Learning Path

Recommended order for learning:
1. Arrays (fundamental)
2. Linked Lists (introduces pointers/references)
3. Stacks (builds on arrays/linked lists)
4. Queues (similar to stacks, different principle)
5. Trees (hierarchical data)
6. Graphs (most complex, builds on all previous concepts)

## Learning Approach

Each data structure module follows a consistent learning approach:

1. **Understand the Basics**
   - Start with the guided tutorial
   - Learn fundamental concepts
   - Understand the structure's properties

2. **Practice Operations**
   - Try basic operations
   - Observe visual feedback
   - Understand time complexities

3. **Apply Knowledge**
   - Explore real-world examples
   - Work through simulations
   - Solve practice problems

4. **Test Understanding**
   - Take built-in quizzes
   - Review key concepts
   - Verify comprehension

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required
- Works on all major operating systems
